# Chromapper-DraggableWindows
This plugin allows you to drag around different windows in ChroMapper that may get in the way, including:
- Chroma Colour Wheel
- Node Editor
- BPM Tapper
- Strobe Generator

You can also now switch between using Shift and Click to drag or just click to drag!

# Known Issues
- Switching between Shift+Click to drag might make the window not draggable until it is reopened and closed
- Some windows after being dragged down do not go fully out of screen when closed

also i've never used github before so i don't really know what i'm doing x2
